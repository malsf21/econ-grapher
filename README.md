# Econ Graph Generator

Econ Graph Generator is a JavaScript webapp that can create and analyze basic linear functions, geared towards IB Economics. It generates easily screenshot-able graphs, complete with Graph Titles, Axis Titles, Axis Labelling, and even more (coming soon).

Some example usages of our software include:

* Linear Demand/Supply Functions
* Graphing Market Equilibrium
* Graphing Taxes and Subsidies
* Graphing Negative and Positive Externalities


We used [charts.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).
